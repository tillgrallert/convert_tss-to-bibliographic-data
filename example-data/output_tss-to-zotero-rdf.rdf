      <dcterms:abstract>#Justification of re-edition (7)- the authors are  aware of this text having been published and edited before at least twice. at least one of the two manuscripts held at StaBi, which form the basis of their work, had been used for earlier editions. Yet, even in the case where they come to conclusions similar to those of Sabānū—as, for instance, that the (one) author must have been a clerk in Sherīf Pasha's service (14)—they make no reference to his work. - Aḥmad Ghassān Sabānū re-edited the well-known manuscript held at Stabi (No. 9787 / MS Petermann 188), of which a microfilm copy is available at AUB. The book was published in Damascus in 1980.- al-Khūrī Qusṭanṭīn Pasha al-Mukhallisī had published the first edition in the early 20th century.   </dcterms:abstract>

They set up a Consultative Council (majlis mashwara) made up of the notables (aʿyan), gentlemen (afandiyya) and merchants (tujjar), and an Egyptian Christian called Yusuf ʿAyrut474 became the council’s chief clerk (mubashir kitabat al-diwan), while Khawaja Rufaʾil remained director of the treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;A few days after the Vizier arrived, the price of a ratl of bread rose from 44 to 60 fidda, and one mudd of wheat which had cost 6 kuruş was priced at 8 kuruş, but could not be found [even at that price]. Thus all the Vizier’s speeches had no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;At the beginning of Lent (al-Sawm al-Kabir),106 the situation worsened. One mudd of wheat was sold in the city107 for 14 kuruş, one mudd of barley for 8 kuruş, maize for 10 kuruş, and a ratl of rice for 5 kuruş. Because the bakers in the market received only small quantities of flour, the situation at the bakeries was dreadful, and people waited half the day to get their bread. By the first Friday of Lent, things had become even worse. The people, stretched to the limit, snatched about 50 trays108 of bread in the streets and from the bakeries. They even stole dough in the streets, and from the knead-ing troughs inside the bakeries.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;
    
         &lt;div style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
        
        &lt;span&gt;(p.61)&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;h1&gt;# Coming back to the [issue of] bread, when ...&lt;/h1&gt;
    
        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Coming back to the [issue of] bread, when the authorities [lowered and] set the price of one ratl at 60 fidda, people waited to see what would happen. Within only a few days of their lowering the price, the bread [offered for sale] was as dark as liver104 and even then it as hardly available. By the end of January the price of [1 mudd of] wheat was 8 kuruş, but by the beginning of February, it had risen to 10 kuruş and more. One ratl of flour cost 3 kuruş and a loaf of white bread the size of a large biscuit (qataʾif) was 4 fidda, or 3½ kuruş for a ratl. A loaf of white oven bread (tannuri) was 8 fidda, or about 4½ kuruş for a ratl, and a ratl of brown rusks cost 4½ kuruş, too, as did a ratl of ‘military rice’ (al-ruzz al-ʿaskari),105 and other prices were at a similar level. This entire situation was due to the government’s inaction, while [real] au-thority  remained in the hands of local leaders (awlad al-balad), who  did whatever they wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Some soldiers camped in the city’s artisan workshops and trading houses. Neither bread nor flour was to be found, because all the mills had been taken over by the government, as explained before, and the price of one ratl of bread reached 6 kuruş.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The anonymous Arabic chronicle that is presented here1 offers rich and de-tailed information about political and social transformations between 1831 and 1841 as experienced by a citizen of Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;This edition and translation of the chronicle tries to demonstrate that the text is not only a source of historical facts, but also an important document on the ways Arab inhabitants of the Levant in the 1830s and 40s thought and communicated about the social and political realities of their period. The value of the text is greatly enhanced by the fact that we have two ver-sions of it&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The English translation makes the chronicle ac-cessible to a wider readership with an interest in the history of the Middle East. For practical reasons, it follows MS Petermann 188, which is the more elaborate and better preserved of the two texts.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The present publication was initiated by the discovery of an anonymous Arabic manuscript among the papers left upon his death by Johann Gott- fried Wetzstein, the first Prussian Consul assigned to the Ottoman Province of Damascus from 1849 to 1861.1 This discovery was made in the 1980s by Ingeborg Huhn as she prepared her doctoral dissertation based on the Wetzstein Papers, which are kept in the State Library of Berlin.2 As it even-tually became clear that the manuscript was a hitherto unknown recension of the Arabic chronicle known  as  Mudhakkirat Tarikhiyya or ‘Historical Memoirs’, which is also among the holdings of the Berlin State Library,3 we decided to publish a parallel edition of both texts together with an anno-tated English translation of the more elaborate version of the text (MS Pe-termann 188).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;At least the MS Petermann 188 has been edited before by Sabānū&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Given the importance of the events described in the text, it is not surprising that one of the two known recensions of this chronicle was edited as early as the 1920s by a Lebanese scholar, Qustantin al-Basha al-Mukhallisi,4 and that a second edition, by a Syrian scholar, Ghassan Sabanu, was published in 1980.5 Nevertheless, only relatively few historians of the period have used the text as a source,6 although many fields of study still might profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The title we have chosen for this book, ‘Damascus Affairs’, attempts to capture the basic element of the text’s historical narrative: selected public events or ‘affairs’ (Ar. hawadith or maddat) that were discussed in the author’s hometown Damascus during the years 1831-41.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The four decades between 1830 and 1870, in particular, can be regarded as a prolonged period of crisis, which reached its peak during anti-Christian riots in Mount Lebanon and Damascus in 1860.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Thus, we can locate the author - or at least the author of this particular episode - in the scribal offices of the government building in Damascus. This also explains why the text quotes extensively from government documents and presents first-hand reports on the provincial administration.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;This has already been noted by Sabānū, who should have been mentioned here&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;the author of the text belonged to the Greek Ortho-dox community, for he addresses the Greek Orthodox Patriarch residing in Damascus as ‘our lord the patriarch’36 and he sympathises with the Greek Orthodox in his description of quarrels between them and the Catholics in 1832.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;# textile industries / market&lt;/h1&gt;
    
        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;the author of these passages was well acquainted with the textile market and its social milieu.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;
    
         &lt;div style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
        
        &lt;span&gt;(p.16)&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;h1&gt;# Finally, the author’s language shows him to be ...&lt;/h1&gt;
    
        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Finally, the author’s language shows him to be a native of Syria, as he uses a number of terms and expressions typical for Levantine dialects, such as zalama (pl. zilim) for ‘man’ or ‘infantry soldier’, and siran for ‘trip’ or ‘out-ing’.40 It would be most interesting to see whether this dialect vocabulary is attributable to a specific town or region within Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;Sabānū 1980@7 did exactly that and claimed that the author had a recognisable Tripolitanian accent&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;
    
         &lt;div style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
        
        &lt;span&gt;(p.16)&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;h1&gt;# likely author: ʿAbdallah Nawfal from Tripoli&lt;/h1&gt;
    
        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;So it does indeed seem likely that the author was ʿAbdallah Nawfal, the father of the young Salim. At any rate, the passage indicates a close relationship with the Nawfal family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;
    
         &lt;div style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
        
        &lt;span&gt;(p.16)&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;h1&gt;# The Lebanese historian ʿIsa Iskandar al-Maʾluf (1868-1956) has ...&lt;/h1&gt;
    
        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The Lebanese historian ʿIsa Iskandar al-Maʾluf (1868-1956) has advanced the thesis that the author of the chronicle was a native of Tripoli in  Lebanon (Ta r a b u l u s a l - S h a m),  ʿAbdallah ibn Jirjis Nawfal (1797-1866).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;This again fits Sabānū's judgement, which they at least mention in the footnote&lt;/p&gt;
    
         &lt;/div&gt;
    
         &lt;div style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;The most prominent of them was ʿAbdallah Nawfal’s  nephew, Nawfal Niʿmatallah Nawfal (1812-87), who spent his childhood years in Cairo and returned to Syria in 1828, where he served in several official positions and acquired some fame as an historian.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Our author was obviously not a professional scholar, but one of many Syrian ‘commoner chroniclers’ who kept diaries and compiled historical re-ports during this period.51 Thus he does not cite any other writings as sec-ondary sources and concentrates exclusively on the period he himself wit-nessed. For whom, then, did he write? Considering the numerous blank lines and amendments in MS Petermann 188 (see fig. 1), one might take it for the unfinished autograph of a chronicle that had not yet circulated in public.52 However, the discovery of MS Wetzstein, a second version of the chronicle written by another hand, clearly demonstrates that the chronicle was copied several times and can thus be considered a published text.53 It seems probable that the text, especially the more concise and entertaining version in MS Wetzstein, was read out in front of a, mainly Christian, audi-ence in private gatherings or in coffeehouses.5&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;Among them is the term ahali (here mostly translated as ‘the city’s local inhabitants’). Ahali was generally used as a neutral term for the population of a certain location, as in ‘the people of Damascus’. However, in the chronicle the term consistently refers to the Muslim population. Then there is a group designated as awlad al-balad (here: ‘the local towns-men’ or ‘the locals’). In the chronicle, this term mostly refers to members of the above-mentioned localist faction, who led the revolt of 1831. The author does not count himself and the Greek Orthodox among the ‘locals’.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus they gathered and decorated a camel on top of which they seated Hamza al-Dhikra, a Muslim from the Kharab neighbourhood. They also put two bot-tles of arak147 on the camel’s back and carried two or three torches in the shape of crosses which they decorated with flowers and fruits. The proces-sion departed from Taliʿ al-Qubba with lines [of men] on either side, carry-ing wooden staffs. A crowd followed, also with sticks, some performing ac-robatic stunts, and others, led by a man with a baton, chanting rhymes like ‘Hail to the victorious Ibrahim Pasha! May God curse those who have been humiliated! (Ibrahim Pasha ya mansur, Allah yalʿan al-maqhur)’ and such like. The torches in the shape of crosses were carried amongst them and bringing up the rear was the decorated camel with the Muslim on its back. Whenever they advanced a few paces, he would take one of the bottles and wave it above the [on-looking] Muslims’ heads, shouting: ‘Christ is risen!’,148 while taking a swig [from the bottle].&lt;/p&gt;

The procession went along with incense burners, perfume bottles and candles towards Bab Tuma, the Zaynabiyya, Mazz al-Qasab, ʿAmara, Surujiyya and the Saray, where they collected donations. Then they went on to Darwishiyya, Suq Jaqmaq,183 Khayyatin, Suq al-Silah, al-Buzuriyya, Maʾdhanat al-Shahm, and Taliʿ al-Qubba.

News of this reached the Vizier, and he immediately sent the soldiers to the city to kill, and rob and insult [them]. First the soldiers attacked a neighbourhood called Qanawat; they plun-dered it, abused its women and set fire to it. This was precisely the place where the salyane had been assessed first! He then sent an order to the citadel to shell the city with cannon and rifle fire. The soldiers were killing, plundering, burning and rob-bing, and those in the citadel shelled the city with cannon fire, intending to de-stroy it.

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;After that, an order was issued by Ibrahim Pasha that a [government] win-ery (khammara) should be established in Damascus, and he ordered the ad-ministrative council to make an announcement in the Christian and Jewish quarters and elsewhere so that the rights to it could be auctioned.185 The auction continued for fifteen days, and the licence was eventually sold for 700 purses (kis). The licence became valid on the Feast of the Cross and there were Christians, Jews and Muslims among the licensees. They took the Khan al-Masbana in the Kharab neighbourhood and the starch factory (Qaʿat al-Nashaʾ) and turned them over to wine production. The Muslims were visibly very downcast, because nothing like this had ever happened before in Damascus. One could see that the customers there were Muslims, Christians and Jews, and that arak and wine were openly served in coffee-houses and in the streets, including in ʿAli Ibn Munin’s coffeehouse, the Bab Sharqi Coffeehouse, the Bab Tuma Coffeehouse and stalls in Bab al-Jabiya, in the Horse Market, and in Bab al-Musalla.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote style="background-color:#DCD9C7"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&gt;A general order was issued to the effect that those who sold arak and wine or offered to sell arak and wine without a licence from the official wine producers would be subject to severe punishment (zayan).186 The authorities fixed the price of a ratl of arak at 12 kuruş and a ratl of wine at 6 kuruş.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&gt;People lined the streets, and a huge crowd followed him, most of whom were not able even to catch a glimpse of him [because the street was too crowded].&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;- the authors are  aware of this text having been published and edited before at least twice. at least one of the two manuscripts held at StaBi, which form the basis of their work, had been used for earlier editions. Yet, even in the case where they come to conclusions similar to those of Sabānū—as, for instance, that the (one) author must have been a clerk in Sherīf Pasha's service (14)—they make no reference to his work. &lt;/p&gt;
                
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;- Aḥmad Ghassān Sabānū re-edited the well-known manuscript held at Stabi (No. 9787 / MS Petermann 188), of which a microfilm copy is available at AUB. The book was published in Damascus in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                    
                    &lt;p&gt;- al-Khūrī Qusṭanṭīn Pasha al-Mukhallisī had published the first edition in the early 20th century.   &lt;/p&gt;
